This is a JavaScript-everywhere project:

| **Project**    | **Library used**
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------
| server-side    | [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
| client-side    | browser
| mobile         | [phonegap](http://phonegap.com/)
| standalone     | [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
| build-system   | [grunt](gruntjs.com)

Building
------------

Prequisites
----------------------
Build system uses grunt project and node-pre-gyp so first you need to install the two:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli node-pre-gyp@0.4.1 
```

If you want to be able to build mobile clients yourself you're also going to need phonegap package:
```
npm install -g phonegap@3.2.0-0.2.0
```

`NOTE:` phonegap is in older version due to [this bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21388709/cordova-3-3-1-0-1-2-phonegap-plugins-doesnt-work)

Dependencies
----------------------
After you have required global modules you can start with installation by issuing:
```
npm install
```
This should download all dependencies as well as precompbiled binary modules using node-pre-gyp. Support for most popular platforms is out-of-the box but not all so you can build native modules on your own using [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) or contact me to provide binary for your platform :)
